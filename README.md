## What is Fyuze?

A dependencyless, PSR-compliant, 100% tested and maximum quality framework created for the sole purpose of learning.

## Build & Run

> For building an application, you should probably check out [fyuze/skeleton](https://github.com/fyuze/skeleton) for a basic implementation.

Just checkout the repository, install dependencies and run.

    git clone https://github.com/fyuze/framework.git
    composer install
    phpunit

## Can I use it?

You can, but probably shouldn't until a release has been tagged.

## How can I help?

I am interested in any suggestions to help better existing code/implementations or just feedback on what is done poorly.
 Please don't PR full-blown components.
